Examples
========

There are three distinct examples for how to use the PA4RDF annotations.  

* for [Interface](./examples/interface.html)
* for [Abstract Class](./examples/abstractClass.html)
* for [Concrete Class](./examples/concreteClass.html)

Each of the examples shows how to annotate a Book interface or abstract class to store the 
information about the book in a graph.
