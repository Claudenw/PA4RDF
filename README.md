# PA4RDF
Persistence Annotation for RDF (PA4RDF) is a set of annotations and an entity manager that provides JPA like functionality on top of an RDF store while accounting for and exploiting the fundamental differences between graph storage and relational storage.  	PA4RDF introduces several annotations that map a RDF triple (subject, predicate, object) to a Plain Old Java Object (POJO) using Java's dynamic proxy capabilities.
